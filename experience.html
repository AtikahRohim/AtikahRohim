Ride a banana boat with my family. 
It was a great experience because I enjoy it even though it was a bit scary. 
We ride the banana boat at Port Dickson when we are having vacation.
We are having so much fun until I still can't forget this moments.
Even though the vacation only for 2 days 1 night, but we make good memories.
